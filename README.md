# BREAST_CANCER-ML-PROJECT

In this we are comparing different machine leaning models like RandomForest , DecisionTree,XGBoost 

## Project Overview
Project Title: Breast_Cancer ML
Level: Intermediate 
Database: load_breast_cancer

This project is designed to demonstrate pandas,Matplot,Python and ML skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a Breast_Cancer ML, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and findding best model to perform the predictions. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in ML.**


## Objectives

1.	Set up a data
2.	Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4.	Business Analysis
5.	Calling different models to compare the speed and their accuracy.

## Findings
Feature importance showing feature no.27 is very important.
Graph of Logloss showing the trend of verbosity , also having 96% accuracy.

  Model	            Accuracy	  Duration
0	XGBoot	           0.956140	  0.0795
1	RandomForest	     0.964912	  0.2947
2	GradientBoosting   0.964912	  0.6936

This shows gradient boosting is more accurate but its timing is high on the other hand XGBoost is very less time consuming.
